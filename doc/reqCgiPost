The old clock tower stood at the center of the village, its hands frozen at midnight for as long as anyone could remember. Stories swirled among the villagers about why it had stopped-some claimed it was cursed, while others whispered of forgotten rituals. At the base of the tower, ivy crept up the stone walls, winding itself around the door that hadnâ€™t been opened in generations. One day, a stranger arrived. She was dressed in black, with eyes that gleamed like stars. Without a word, she walked straight to the door and knocked three times. The air seemed to grow still as if time itself had paused to watch. When the door creaked open, the villagers held their breath. No one knew what lay beyond that threshold, but they would soon find out.
